Previous research has indicated that physiological signals can be used to detect mental stress. There is however no consensus on the optimal algorithm for this detection. The aim of this study is to compare different machine learning techniques for the measurement of stress based on physiological responses in a controlled environment. Electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), temperature and respiration were measured during a laboratory stress test. Six machine learning techniques were investigated using a general and personal approach. The results show that personalized dynamic Bayesian networks and generalized support vector machines render the best average classification results with 84.6 % and 82.7 % respectively.
