I am an Assistant Research Professor at Rice University working within the Digital Health Initiative. I completed my PhD in Data Science (ECE) at the Digital Health Labs (Rice University).
My primary academic interests lie in machine learning and data science applications in (mental) healthcare. During my PhD research, I have focused on objective sociability and impulsivity measures for dimensional psychiatry. Healthcare research is an area where the confluences of fundamental research and direct practical applications are aplenty. In the long term, I want to contribute with research to uncover previously unknown fundamental axioms that bound/run us (or our world).

In the past, I have worked as a research scientist at the [Philps Research](https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/innovation.html) and [IMEC-Holst Center](https://holstcentre.com/). I worked on several projects related to patient monitoring, developing novel measurement techniques and approaches for blood pressure monitoring, computer vision-based patient activity monitoring and diagnosis, wearable systems for early warning indicators of health degradation, novel patient monitoring architectures to support data-driven innovations, the development of cloud computing platform (streaming, storage, and computation) to support the ranges of internal research and advance developments. I also spent an extended summer at [Samsung Research America](https://sra.samsung.com/) as a research intern. There, I worked to develop earbuds-based health applications.
